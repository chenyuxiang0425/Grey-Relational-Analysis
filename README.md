# Grey-Relational-Analysis

## What is it?
This is a python implementation of『Grey Relational Analysis』 for my classmates.  
Gray correlation analysis is based on the degree of similarity of the geometry of the sequence curves to determine whether they are closely linked.Therefore the values for the features that show negative correlation are lower.   
You can get detailed information about it in its [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_relational_analysis).  
You can replace data in 『test_data.csv』with your own data. In 『test_data.csv』, the first column is the target column and the other columns are the feature columns.  

## How to use it?

`$ pip install -r requirments.txt`  
Run:
